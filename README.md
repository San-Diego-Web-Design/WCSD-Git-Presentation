This git repository is my [2012 WordCamp San Diege presentation](http://2012.sandiego.wordcamp.org/schedule/). Below is the outline for the presentation and later my slides will become part of the repo as well.

The idea here is that anyone can contribute to the talk by submitting pull requests or opening up issues for questions or comments.

You can also reach me more privately at [info@jkudish.com](info@jkudish.com) if you'd like.
